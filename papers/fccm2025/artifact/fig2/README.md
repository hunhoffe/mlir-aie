# Notes

Compared to Figure 2 in the paper, these examples:
* Define constants
* Import classes
* Were formatted using ```black```, so the whitespace/formatting may differ a bit.
* Version using extended API in the paper does not use ```TensorAccessPattern```, since not introduced in paper yet because of flow of narrative. Version here uses TensorAccessPattern instead of sizes/strides, which is a change noted in the last sentence of Section V.
